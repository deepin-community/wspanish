      the check and Pierre Habouzit for reminding.

    dicionaries-common already have it

 -- Agustín Martín Domingo <agmartin@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Sep 2001 15:59:16 +0200

words-spanish (1.0-10) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt against new dictionaries-common-dev

 -- Agustín Martín Domingo <agmartin@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Jul 2001 16:55:52 +0200

words-spanish (1.0-9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debhelper and dictionaries-common build dependency.
  * Raised policy to 3.1.0
  * words.5: Changed references to /usr/dict by references to
    /usr/share/dict

    /usr/dict
  * man pages now installed under /usr/share/man
  * debian/rules: Added removal of words_debinst generated files to clean tag

 -- Agustín Martín Domingo <agmartin@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2000 13:50:50 +0200

  * Renamed source package to words-ispanish
  * Migrated to debhelper

    upgrading from /usr/dict/spanish to /usr/share/dict/spanish. Closes
    40324

    generate them.

 -- Agustín Martín Domingo <agmartin@aq.upm.es>  Tue, 20 Jun 2000 13:39:21 +0200

wspanish (1.0-7) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Uses /usr/share/dict for FHS compliance
  * Uses update-alternatives to manage /usr/share/dict/words.
  (Closes Bug#27951)
  * Close the bugs fixed by the previous NMU. (Closes Bug#19600)

 -- Enrique Zanardi <ezanard@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Oct 1998 11:52:11 +0100

wspanish (1.0-6.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer release.
  * Use the same postinst, prerm, and postrm scripts for wspanish as for
    the other wordlist packages.  This partially deals with the excessive
    prompting mentioned in #7454 and #19600.  A proper solution requires
    changing all wordlist packages to use update-alternatives, but that
    is best left for Debian 2.1.
  * Install stuff under /usr/doc without execute bit set.  (Lintian)

 -- Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpbs@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Apr 1998 04:03:38 +0100
